# Regarding MPS based components

âš  IMPORTANT 

All MPS based components were moved from this repository over to a [new repository called modelix/modelix.mps](https://github.com/modelix/modelix.mps/).
The publishing workflow of this repository has been disabled for this repository and remaining components will either follow a new versioning and publishing schema and/or move to their own respective repositories.

# The Modelix Project

The Modelix project develops a next generation language workbench that is native to the web and the cloud, inspired by [this document](http://voelter.de/data/pub/APlatformForSystemsAndBusinessModeling.pdf). On the path to this final vision, the short-term goal is to use MPS as the backend. To this end, we currently develop two components:

* Database/Cloud storage for MPS models with realtime collaboration
* Server-based execution of MPS and browser-based editors



# How to run Modelix

You need to install a Kubernetes cluster.
For development or evaluation [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) might be the easiest option.

## Docker Desktop
Make sure to enable Kubernetes in the preferences.
Under _Resources_ change the memory limit to 8 GB or more.

If you use Docker Desktop >= 4.2.0 you have to add the option `"deprecatedCgroupv1": true`
to the file `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.docker/settings.json`.
Otherwise, MPS (the JBR) will not use the correct memory limit.

## Deploy with Helm

- [Install helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- run `helm install --repo https://artifacts.itemis.cloud/repository/helm-modelix/ dev modelix`
- Helm allows you to deploy multiple instances of modelix to the same cluster.
  You could have one instance for testing and one production instance.
  Just specify a different instance name and hostname when running helm:
  - `helm install --repo https://artifacts.itemis.cloud/repository/helm-modelix/ xyz modelix --set ingress.hostname=xyz.127.0.0.1.nip.io`
    - "xyz" is the name of your modelix instance.
    - "xyz.127.0.0.1.nip.io" is the hostname used to access the modelix instance.
      In a development environment you can use nip.io to get different hostnames that resolve to 127.0.0.1.

## Additional Configuration

### Admin password

After Modelix is deployed make sure to change the password of the admin account.
- Open http://localhost/admin/master/console/#/realms/master/users
- The default password for the user **admin** is **modelix**.
- Navigate to Edit > Credentials > Reset Password
- Enter a new password and disable *Temporary*

### Node Pools

If you are using a cloud provider that supports auto-scaling create a separate node pool for the MPS instances.
Add a taint "**workspace-client**" with the value "**true**" and the type "**NoExecute**".
This taint ensures that the pool can be scaled down after Modelix stopped the MPS instances
and the nodes don't keep running because some other small pod was scheduled to them.

An MPS instances with a lot of languages and plugins can require ~8 GB of memory.
16 GB of memory for a node is a reasonable size.

# Editing the sources

- run `gradlew` in the main directory to download dependencies and build the project
- While the MPS that is used for the build is downloaded automatically, you have to install MPS yourself to use it as the client.
- open the project in the folder "mps" with MPS

# Publishing a new version

To make a new release you will simply need to push a new tag.
Everything is automated: it means that no version number have to be changed manually.
Code in master can be released under tags indicating the version numbers, without qualifiers.
For example, if the last tag from master branch has been "0.0.1", the next tag should be "0.0.2".

See https://semver.org/ for valid version numbers. Helm will fail if the version is not in this format.

The artifacts are published to
- Maven: https://artifacts.itemis.cloud/repository/maven-mps/
- Helm: https://artifacts.itemis.cloud/repository/helm-modelix/
- Docker: https://hub.docker.com/u/modelix
